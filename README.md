# Tech book club landing page - Tailwind CSS

![Design preview for the Tech book club landing page coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Overview

A beautiful, modern and sleek landing page built with Tailwind CSS.

## Challenges Faced

- **Tailwind CSS**
It was my first time building a landing page purely with HTML and Tailwind, so I had to get used to the utility-first syntax and refer to the docs a lot! I also had trouble with the config file that usually comes automatically with Vite setup, and so I had to rely more on vanilla CSS as well.

- **Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.**

## Tools & Techniques:

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** Used for structuring and styling the app.

- **Tailwind CSS:** Main styling framework

- **Problem-Solving:** Debugged and resolved issues with layouts or specific elements and also Tailwind limitations.

## Lessons Learned:

- **Tailwind CSS Mastery** Gained a solid understanding and practice of the Tailwind ecosystem and practise!

- **Debugging:** Further developed problem-solving skills by identifying and fixing layout/specific-element errors.
